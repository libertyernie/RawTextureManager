    <hr size="2" width="100%"><b>Raw Texture Manager </b>is designed to
    help you extract and replace the textures inside Super Smash Bros.
    Melee's uncompressed data files. It doesn't analyze the files or
    their structure in any way; rather, it tries to match the filename
    of the .dat file you're trying to open with one or more <b>definition


      files</b><b> </b>in the Definitions folder. Each definition file
    lists the locations, formats, and sizes of each texture in the .dat
    file it is describing.<br>
    <h3>Definition file format</h3>
    <p>Definition files are in <a href="http://json.org/">JSON</a>, a
      data-interchange format derived from JavaScript and commonly used
      to transmit data on the web from one site to another.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Each definition file contains an object with three attributes:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>Name:</b> a filename or pattern to match. For example,
        PlMr??.dat will match PlMrNr.dat, PlMrBu.dat, and so on, but not
        PlMr.dat. When opening a file, Raw Texture Manager will use only
        definitions whose Name attribute matches the filename.</li>
      <li><b>Description</b>: shown in the Help → Available Definitions
        window.</li>
      <li><b>Textures: </b>An array of one or more textures in the
        file. Each texture definition has the following attributes:</li>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Name: </b>The name that the texture will appear under in
          Raw Texture Manager's list.</li>
        <li><b>Type:</b> The type of the texture. BrawlLib is used to
          extract and replace textures; common formats include CMPR and
          CI8.</li>
        <li><b>Width:</b> The width of the texture, in pixels.<br>
        </li>
        <li><b>Height:</b> The height of the texture, in pixels.</li>
        <li><b>Location:</b> The offset in the file where the texture
          starts. Can be specified as a hexadecimal string, e.g.
          "0x14240".</li>
        <li><b>Palette: </b>An optional attribute (used for indexed
          formats like CI8 only.) This is an object with three
          additional attributes:</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Type:</b> The type of the palette; typically RGB565 or
            RGB5A3.</li>
          <li><b>Colors: </b>The number of colors in the palette.</li>
          <li><b>Location: </b>The offset in the file where the
            palettte starts. Can be specified as a hexadecimal string,
            e.g. "0x18240".</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
    </ul>
    <p>This version of Raw Texture Manager contains definitions for:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Roy (any color)</li>
      <li>Kirby (any color)</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Donkey Kong hat (any color)</li>
        <li>Falco hat (any color)<br>
        </li>
        <li>Mewtwo hat (any color)</li>
        <li>Jigglypuff hat (any color)</li>
        <li>Mario hat (one file applies to all colors)</li>
      </ul>
      <li>Link (any color)</li>
      <li>Mario (any color)</li>
      <li>Pikachu (any color)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>When opening a custom texture, make sure the filename ends with
      the original Melee filename; i.e. <b>MyTexture][PlMrNr.dat</b>.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <ul>
        <ul>
        </ul>
